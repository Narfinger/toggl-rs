# toggl-rs

This is a typed interface to [version 8 of the Toggl API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/toggl_api.md). This is considered very much a work in progress, PRs and feedback encouraged! The library can be found in the toggl_rs folder as we are using cargo workspaces.


## CLI
Run the CLI simply with cargo. We currently need a file 'api_token' with your api token in it before compilation. For usage of the CLI please see its help menu (cargo run -- --help).
